# fmt-iatemplate

[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) is a cross-platform tool for focused writing, removing distractions and keeping the writing flow.

The app is Markdown-based, lacks any plugins but [supports templating](https://ia.net/writer/support/preview/templates), allowing for adding plugins.

Searching for a template that has (at least) MermaidJS support, I found [fiser_iatemplate](https://github.com/f1se4/fiser_iatemplate). The repo seems abandoned and it has a bug that prevents MermaidJS from rendering.

Although [I proposed a fix](https://github.com/f1se4/fiser_iatemplate/pull/3), I still prefer the iA Writer Github built-in template, so taking inspiration in the previous work, I've build this template that adds MermaidJS, ChartJS, Plotly and Prism highlighting (with fixes for some collisons on the dark theme) to the GitHub base template.

So please enjoy and feel free to propose any changes or enhancements.
